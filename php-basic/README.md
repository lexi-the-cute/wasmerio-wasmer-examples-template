This is a simple [PHP](https://php.org/) application starter

## Getting Started

Modify the logic of your the PHP application in the `app/index.php` file.

```console
$ echo '<?php echo "Hello world"; ?>' > ./app/index.php
```

You can run things locally with:


```
$ php -t app -S localhost:8080
```
